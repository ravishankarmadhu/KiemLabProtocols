## Description
This protocol outlines the basics of how to analyze your flow data, specifically for the [[RM007a - NHP Lineage Panel]]. It won't explain how to use the software but will give guidelines on the gating strategy. 


## Things to Note before starting
### Good Workflow
Keeping your data organized is extremely important, especially when working with longitudinal studies after a transplant that can span the course of 2 years. Here are some tips to ensure you keep your data organized
- Always export both the experiment and .FCS files from the Flow Cytometers downstairs to the Kiem Lab Server. Stefan has a very robust file library for the Flow Cytometers, use it for the export. 
- When it is time to analyze files, have a folder in your Lab Member Folder on the Server where you can store the Workspace Files and copies of all the .FCS files you are analyzing. 
- Process each experiment in a different Workspace File, and do different gating strategies in different workspace files. 
- Export the images you receive from the analysis as PowerPoint files and the tables you make as .csv files


## Procedure

This is generally the accepted Lineage breakdown. 


## Next Steps
You will want to generate graphs in PRISM detailing the lineage composition (Gran, Mono, B Cell, NK Cell, and T Cell) for each timepoint you take.
