# CD34+ Enrichment
### Protocol by Ravishankar Madhu  
Last Updated: 2023-7-10

## Description 
This protocol outlines how to enrich White Blood Cells (WBCs) for cells containing the surface cell marker CD34. This enrichment is applicable to both Human and Non-human Primate (NHP) CD34-positive cells.

## Reagents and Materials
- NHP or Human WBCs (usually from Bone Marrow (BM))
- [[RM034 - List of Commonly Used Lab Buffers#MACS Buffer|MACS Buffer]]
- Miltenyi LS Magnet Columns
- Miltenyi Magnet Rack
- CD34 12.8 Antibody
- Miltenyi IgM Antibody

## Things to Note before starting
### Sample Processing
This procedure assumes a starting input of WBCs. This is primarily done by either [[RM001 - PB or BM Lyse for WBC Isolation|Lysing Cells with Hemolytic Buffer]] or via [[RM003 - Ficoll Mononuclear Cells Isolation|Ficoll Purification]]. See the following protocols for further explanation:

- [[RM001 - PB or BM Lyse for WBC Isolation]]
- [[RM003 - Ficoll Mononuclear Cells Isolation]]

CD34 enrichments usually require further processing that demands a high degree of sterility. Therefore, it is important to conduct all steps in a TC Hood.

### Estimated Timing
This protocol occurs after isolating WBCs from BM, which takes approximately 30 minutes. The enrichment protocol includes two 30-minute incubation steps and several 5-minute spins. On average, the full protocol from BM to enriched CD34 cells will take approximately 3.5-4.0 hours.


## Procedure
1. Resuspend WBCs in 50mL of [[RM034 - List of Commonly Used Lab Buffers#MACS Buffer|MACS Buffer]]. 
2. Using 190uL of [[RM034 - List of Commonly Used Lab Buffers#MACS Buffer|MACS Buffer]] and 10uL of cell suspension, create a 1:10 dilution. [^1]
3. Count the cells via [[RM030 - Counting with the Countess|the Countess]]. Calculate the total number of living WBCs.
4. Save 3 aliquots[^2] of the 50mL Cell resuspension for [[RM006 - Staining Cells for Flow|Flow Analysis]]. These 3 aliquots will be unstained, stained with the [[RM007b - NHP HSC Panel|HSC Panel]], and stained with the [[RM007a - NHP Lineage Panel|Lineage Panel]]. 
5. Spin down the cells at 800 x g for 5 minutes. Aspirate to the pellet. 
6. Resuspend the cell pellet in **1mL of [[MACS Buffer]] per 1e8 WBCs. 
7. Add 12.8 Antibody to the cell suspension to create **a final 12.8 concentration of 20ug/mL**. [^3]
8. Incubate the solution for 30 minutes in a gentle shaker / rocker at 4C. 
9. Wash the solution in 50mL of [[RM034 - List of Commonly Used Lab Buffers#MACS Buffer|MACS Buffer]]. Spin down at 800 x g for 5 minutes. Aspirate to the pellet.
10. Resuspend pellet in 50mL of [[RM034 - List of Commonly Used Lab Buffers#MACS Buffer|MACS Buffer]]. 
11. Using 190uL of [[RM034 - List of Commonly Used Lab Buffers#MACS Buffer|MACS Buffer]] and 10uL of cell suspension, create a 1:10 dilution. [^1]
12. Count the cells via [[RM030 - Counting with the Countess|the Countess]]. Calculate the total number of living WBCs.
13. Spin down the cells at 800 x g for 5 minutes. Aspirate to the pellet. 
14. Resuspend the cell pellet in **0.9mL of [[MACS Buffer]] per 1e8 of WBCs.
15. Add **1mL of IgM Antibody per 1e9 of WBCs**.
16. Incubate solution for 30 minutes in a gentle shaker / rocker at 4C. 
17. Wash the solution in 50mL of [[RM034 - List of Commonly Used Lab Buffers#MACS Buffer|MACS Buffer]]. Spin down at 800 x g for 5 minutes. Aspirate to the pellet. 
18. Calculate the number of Miltenyi LS Columns needed for this purification. Generally, **use 1 column per 0.6e9 WBCs.**
19. Set up the Miltenyi LS Columns with a Magnet Rack, 70um filter, and 50mL flow through collection tube.
20. Resuspend cell pellet in **2mL of [[MACS Buffer]] per Miltenyi LS Columns** you are going to use. 
21. Wet each column with 2mL of [[RM034 - List of Commonly Used Lab Buffers#MACS Buffer|MACS Buffer]].
22. Add 2mL of cell suspension to each column.
23. Wash each column with 6mL of [[RM034 - List of Commonly Used Lab Buffers#MACS Buffer|MACS Buffer]].
24. Wash each column with 7mL of [[RM034 - List of Commonly Used Lab Buffers#MACS Buffer|MACS Buffer]].
25. Take the Miltenyi LS Columns off the Magnet Rack. Add 5mL of [[RM034 - List of Commonly Used Lab Buffers#MACS Buffer|MACS Buffer]] and use the provided plunger to elute the cells into a 15mL tube.  
26. Spin down the positive fraction at 800 x g for 5 minutes. Aspirate to the pellet.
27. Resuspend the cell pellet in an appropriate volume. [^4]
28. Count the cells via [[RM030 - Counting with the Countess|the Countess]]. 

## Next Steps
The purified CD34+ cells should be QCed by [[RM006 - Staining Cells for Flow|flow]] with the [[RM007b - NHP HSC Panel|HSC panel]]. The cells can be further used for the following purposes:
- In vitro experiments
- [[RM012 - Freezing Down Living Cells]]
- [[RM004 - NHP Ex-Vivo Transplant]]
- [[RM010 - Creating CFCs Plates]]
- [[RM033 - Creating Cell Pellets]]

### Recipe's for Buffers
#### MACS Buffer

This reagent is used to keep cells undergoing a CD34+ Enrichment stable and happy. This should be stored in either the cold room, or in the TC Room Fridge if being used.

- 2.5g of Bovine Serum Albumin
- 2mL of 0.5M EDTA
- 500mL PBS
- Sterilized by filtering with a 0.22um Vacuum Filter


### Footnotes
[^1]: The exact dilution can be adjusted depending on your input of cells. If you feel that you do not have enough cells - perform a 1:2 or 1:4 dilution. If you feel that you have a lot of cells - perform a 1:100 dilution. The total volume of your dilution should range from 50uL-200uL. 
[^2]: I would recommend an aliquot volume of 100uL
[^3]: The 12.8 Antibody is located in vials within the -80 Freezer. The stock concentration of the antibody in that tube is written on the tube's exterior. Take care to note the stock concentration as this can change when we get a new batch of 12.8 antibody. 
[^4]: I would recommend 1mL or 5mL depending on the size of the cell pellet.
