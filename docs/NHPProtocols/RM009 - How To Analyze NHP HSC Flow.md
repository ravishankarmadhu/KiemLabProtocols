## Description
This protocol outlines the basics of how to analyze your flow data, specifically for the [[RM007b - NHP HSC Panel]]. It won't explain how to use the software but will give guidelines on the gating strategy. 


## Things to Note before starting
### Good Workflow
Keeping your data organized is extremely important, especially when working with longitudinal studies after a transplant that can span the course of 2 years. Here are some tips to ensure you keep your data organized
- Always export both the experiment and .FCS files from the Flow Cytometers downstairs to the Kiem Lab Server. Stefan has a very robust file library for the Flow Cytometers, use it for the export. 
- When it is time to analyze files, have a folder in your Lab Member Folder on the Server where you can store the Workspace Files and copies of all the .FCS files you are analyzing. 
- Process each experiment in a different Workspace File, and do different gating strategies in different workspace files. 
- Export the images you receive from the analysis as PowerPoint files and the tables you make as .csv files


## Procedure

You can also look into the CD90 Expression by making a plot of CD45RA (x-axis) vs CD90 (y-axis). The top left corner is the CD90+ cells. 



## Next Steps
You will want to generate graphs in PRISM detailing the composition of the HSC Subtypes (CD34High, CD34 Mid, CD90+, etc).
