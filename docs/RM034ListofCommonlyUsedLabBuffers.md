## Description
This protocol lists out the commonly used lab buffers and which protocol they are used in. 

## Protein Purification Buffers
### Freestyle Media
The FreeStyle Media is used to culture the HEK293f cells used in Protein Production. This media is ordered and is normally stored in 1L plastic bottles in the Cold Room. Bottles that are actively being used are stored in Eman's shelf of the Main Lab Fridge next to the Weigh Scale. 

Bottles that are actively being used should be wrapped with Aluminum Foil to prevent UV-Degradation. 

No additives are required before using this Buffer to Culture HEK293f cells, but the buffer should be warmed in the hot water bath before being used. 

#### Protocol(s) of Use
- [[RM027 - Culturing HEK 293f Cells]]


### 5M Imidazole
A reagent that is needed for the creation of other Protein Purification Buffers. This buffer is stored in the cold room and wrapped in aluminum foil. 

- 170.2g of imidazole
- Dissolve in DI-H20 so that the Total Volume is 1000mL
- Sterilize by submitting the solution for Autoclaving. 

==Do Not== just immediately dissolve the imidazole in 1000mL of DI-H20 because that ignores the volume that the imidazole occupies. Dissolve in a smaller volume of DI-H20, and increase the amount of DI-H20 until the total volume reaches 1000mL


### 5M NaCl
A reagent that is used to stabilize the protein supernatant during Protein Purification. This buffer is stored at room Temperature by Eman's Bench or in the Cold Room. 

- 292g of NaCl
- Dissolve in DI-H20 so that the Total Volume is 1000mL
- Sterilize by filtering with a 0.22um Vacuum Filter

==Do Not== just immediately dissolve the NaCl in 1000mL of DI-H20 because that ignores the volume that the NaCl occupies. Dissolve in a smaller volume of DI-H20, and increase the amount of DI-H20 until the total volume reaches 1000mL

### 50mM EDTA
A reagent used in the process of regenerating Ni-Resin. This buffer can be stored either at room temperature at Eman's Bench or in the cold room. 

- 100mL of 0.5M EDTA
- 900mL of DI-H20

### 0.5M NaOH

==Do Not== just immediately dissolve the NiSO<sub>4</sub> &#x2022 6H<sub>2</sub>0 in 1000mL of DI-H20 because that ignores the volume that the Nickle occupies. Dissolve in a smaller volume of DI-H20, and increase the amount of DI-H20 until the total volume reaches 1000mL
