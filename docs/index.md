# Welcome

My name is Ravishankar Madhu, I used to be Research Technician at the [Hans-Peter Kiem](https://www.fredhutch.org/en/faculty-lab-directory/kiem-hans-peter.html) [Lab](https://research.fredhutch.org/kiem/en.html) at the [Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center](https://www.fredhutch.org/en.html) from 2019 to 2023. I created this website to compile all of the protocols I worked on over the years with some comments in the footnotes. By no means are these protocols official documents to be used for publication - they are too casual for that. But hopefully, they should give you an understanding of each protocol from a practical perspective. 

This website is a personal project of mine, as I always wanted a "lab wiki" that could connect all of the protocols together. You should be able to switch between different protocols and buffers like you would any Wikipedia article. If you want to add your own protocols for your projects - feel free to message me and I can provide the tools for you to either add them to this website or for you to create your own wiki for your lab. 

Massive shout out to all the people at the Fred Hutchinson, but especially Stefan Radtke - who really provided me with the opportunity to grow into the person I am today. I would not trade the time I had in the Kiem Lab for anything!

I hope you found this useful.
